E'Los Angeles is a massive sprawling metropolis covering approximately 1,300 km² (502 sq mi) with highly irregular boundaries. The city extends from the Pacific Ocean eastward to the San Gabriel Valley, bounded by mountains (Santa Monica Mountains to the north, San Gabriel Mountains to the northeast). Key geographic features: Pacific coastline (west), downtown core near center coordinates, San Fernando Valley (north), South LA (south), Harbor area/San Pedro (south), and numerous distinct neighborhoods. The city is extremely spread out with varying density - dense urban core downtown, medium-density residential sprawl throughout most areas, and lower density in valley regions. Major unpopulated areas include Griffith Park, mountain ranges, and the Port of Los Angeles industrial zones.',
E'Plumbers serve residential and commercial properties uniformly across populated areas, unlike businesses that cluster downtown. In Los Angeles, plumbers are distributed throughout all residential neighborhoods with slight concentration in: (1) older neighborhoods with aging infrastructure (Mid-City, South LA, East LA), (2) high-density residential areas (Koreatown, Hollywood, Westlake), and (3) suburban areas with single-family homes (Valley regions, West LA). They do NOT cluster in downtown business districts. Coverage must be comprehensive across all residential zones including San Fernando Valley (northern), Westside (Santa Monica to West LA), Central LA, South LA, Harbor area, and eastern neighborhoods. Industrial ports and mountain parks can be avoided.',
E'Given LA''s massive size and uniform plumber distribution, this strategy uses 28 zones with varying radii (2-5km) based on density. High-priority zones cover dense residential areas and older neighborhoods where plumbing services are most needed. Medium-priority zones cover suburban sprawl and valley areas. Low-priority zones cover edge areas and newer developments. Zone spacing ensures complete coverage without excessive overlap, using larger radii (4-5km) in sprawling suburban areas and smaller radii (2-3km) in dense urban cores. This approach balances comprehensive coverage of LA''s 1,300 km² populated area while avoiding mountains, parks, and industrial ports. Estimated 50-80 businesses per zone in dense areas, 30-50 in suburban areas.',

E'Critical strategy failure detected. The downtown LA core zone yielded zero results despite expecting 75 businesses, indicating a fundamental issue with either the search methodology, data source accessibility, or zone parameters. This 100% miss rate suggests we need to completely reassess our approach rather than refine existing zones. The original strategy appears to have had zero planned zones, yet one zone was executed - this inconsistency needs addressing.',
